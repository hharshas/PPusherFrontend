# `PPushr`
### `ReactJS, NodeJS, Socket.IO, IndexedDB, MongoDB, Tailwind`
• Created an alternative music streaming solution to the public that employs a peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle sharing protocol,
reducing reliance on centralized servers. \
• Utilized AudioContext Web APIs to split music ﬁles into chunks of at least 5 MB and store them on diﬀerent clients,
which then serve as seeds to deliver the chunks upon request. \
• Implemented a real-time chunks distribution system feature using WebSocket and Socket.io, enhancing seeds
engagement and reducing response time by 20%. \
• Project Proposal : [GDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hx2uyTV1I3VIsVYGeah_zyg6tYx1rwGGDbJODi_pCGI/)
